"""
The roots of the quadratic equation ax2
 + bx + c = 0, a â‰  0 are given by the following 
formula: 
In this formula, the term b2
 - 4ac is called the discriminant. If b2
 - 4ac = 0, then the 
equation has two equal roots. 
If b2
 - 4ac > 0, the equation has two real roots. If b2
 - 4ac < 0, the equation has two 
complex roots. 
Write a program that prompts the user to input the value of a (the coefficient of x2
), b 
(the coefficient of x), and c (the constant term) and outputs the roots of the quadratic 
equation.
